                After meeting online in 2020, the two engaged in an <span className="font-bold">intimate, online-only relationship</span>.
                Derek claimed to Lyn that he had recently <span className="font-bold">moved from Manchester to Dubai</span> where he supposedly owned a mineral company.
                He used <span className="font-bold">edited pictures</span> stolen from the internet to convince Lyn that he, and the relationship, were genuine.

                As their relationship deepened, Derek began requesting money from Lyn.

                He also pushed her to open <span className="font-bold">multiple cryptocurrency accounts</span> to send money to others that he claimed to be his business associates.

                Derek claimed to be abroad for the duration of the relationship, preventing Lyn from meeting him in person to verify his identity.
                The entirely online nature of their relationship made it easy for him to hide his true self.
