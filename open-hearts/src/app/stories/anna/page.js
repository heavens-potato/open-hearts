                On Zoosk, Anna met “Andrew”, a Bulgarian food importer living in London. 
                The pair spoke for hours on the phone everyday, with Andrew <span className="font-bold">showering Anna with “love and affection”</span>.

                About five weeks into the relationship, Andrew began asking for money. 
                Requests started small, claiming a <span className="font-bold">work crisis</span> and needing help with <span className="font-bold">port charges for a food delivery</span>. 
                However, these requests rapidly escalated, eventually culminating in a fabricated story of being kidnapped and tortured by loan sharks, complete with photos of his supposedly broken arm.

                While Anna and Andrew made plans to meet up, they were quickly canceled by Andrew. 
                This prevented Anna from seeing him in real life and verifying his identity. 
                While they did have video calls, these were later discovered to have used superimposed videos, a sophisticated tactic to deceive victims and hide the scammer’s identity.

                Andrew quickly overwhelmed Anna with "love and affection," a manipulative technique known as love bombing. 
                The goal behind love bombing is to strategically disarm the victim and establish trust early. 
                Anna herself felt "strategically wrapped around his will."

                These requests started small, then quickly ballooned into increasingly dire and expensive emergencies, such as port charges, and eventually a fabricated kidnapping.
