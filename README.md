## ‚ù§Ô∏è About the Project  

Open Hearts is an under-development interactive web exhibit designed to help people learn about and understand the dangers of romance fraud. The exhibit consists of four main sections:

1. **Learn**: An introduction to romance fraud, including how it is defined and how it works.
2. **Stories:** A collection of real-life stories with accompanying red flag and action analysis.
3. **Match or Mismatch**: A memorable mini-game to help users test their understanding.
4. **Resources**: A robust set of resources for victims of romance fraud.
